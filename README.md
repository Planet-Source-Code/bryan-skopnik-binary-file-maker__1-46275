## Binary File Maker


</div>

### Description

This is the first submission by me. What this program will show you is how to make a file combiner, and extractor. It shows you how to combine files into one file.. How to extract all files at once, or single files. The code is fairly easy to follow along. It could be refined but thats oka. Its just to show you how you could put all your images, sounds, etc etc etc. Into one file, then in your program only take out what u need.. So its harder for someone to steal your images, sounds.. etc etc etc.
